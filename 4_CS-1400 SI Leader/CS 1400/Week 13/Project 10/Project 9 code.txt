Since Project 10 builds on Project 9 and since many of you have had trouble with Project 9  have included below a solution for project 9.  This version of console project 9 does not use objects and classes, but it has some very interesting constructs you will appreciate. It was written by a UVU CS graduate Keven Lawance.  I have provided comments to explain these.  Here is the code.

Console.WriteLine("For example, \" Mary 143 \". Just hit Enter when you are done.");
