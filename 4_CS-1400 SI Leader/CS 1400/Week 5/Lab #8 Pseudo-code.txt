//Prompt User to enter the radius of one of the crop circles

//Save radius as a double "R"

//Multiply "R" by 2 to find the length of one side of the square

//Save value as a double "SquareSideLength"

//Multiply Pi * R * R to find the area of each circle

//Save value as a double "AreaCircle"

//Multiply "SquareSideLength" by "SquareSideLength" to find the area of the square

//Save Value as a double "AreaSquare"

//Subtract "AreaSquare" from "AreaCircle" to find the are of the shaded region

//Save value as a double AreaShadedRegion

//Output the "AreaShadedRegion" as a string in the Console say "The area of the shaded region is _______."
