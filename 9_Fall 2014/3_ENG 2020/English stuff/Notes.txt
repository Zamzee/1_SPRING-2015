The Impact of the Built Environment on Bicycle Commuting: Evidence from Beijing
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Abstract

- "bicycle commuting is significantly associated with some features of the built environment"
- increased use of bicycles for commuting affected by:
	- 'higher destination accessibility'
	- 'higher number of exclusive bike lanes'
	- 'a mixed environment'
	- 'greater connectivity between local streets'

Intro

"Most previous studies have found that
the built environment has an effect on
bicycle commuting and that some policy
interventions into the built environment
would encourage an increasing share of
bicycle commuting trips (see a review by
Heinen et al., 2010)" (page 2)


4) Regression Analysis
- commuting time is a large factor in whether or not someone commutes by bike
- the higher the number of designated bike lanes, more bike commuting
- the closer affordable public transportation the less the amount of bicycle commuting

6) Conclusion
- more mainroad or expressway crossings signifcantly related to less cycling
- "This implies that the
most effective way of encouraging cycling
for commuting would be to combine
improvements in bicycle facilities with
urban design."

Effect of Bike Lane Infrastructure on Ridership in one New Orleans Neighborhood
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

"Cycling for transportation or recreation is one lowcost
way to improve physical activity. According to an
engineer (J.E. Ruley PE, written communication, July
2012) from the New Orleans Department of Public
Works, the total cost of the bike lane was less than
1 % of the total road resurfacing project. This research
shows that bike lanes are well suited in diverse urban
areas and that if bike lanes are built, people will use
them." (Page 6)

Determinants of bicycle commuting in the Washington, DC region:
The role of bicycle parking, cyclist showers, and free car parking at work
//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

Intro

"In large US cities bicycling accounts for 0.8% of commutes to work, compared to 10–37% in large bike-friendly cities
in the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany (Pucher and Buehler, 2012)." (Page 1)

"European countries,
such as the Netherlands, Denmark, and Germany, with more commutes by bicycle and fewer commutes by automobile
report much lower CO2 emissions per capita from road passenger transport than the US (1900 versus 4500 kg of CO2 emissions
per capita) (International Energy Agency, 2011)."

Results

"Chisquare
tests indicate that significantly more individuals commute by bike if employers provide cyclist showers, bike lockers,
and bike parking. Free car parking at work is associated with less bike commuting and employer transit benefits are positively
related to cycling to work. Bike commuting is more common for whites, males, individuals in the top income quartile,
trips shorter than 3 miles, and in households with more bicycles. Individuals in households with more cars are less likely to
commute by bike. The share of bike commuters is greater in the urban core, at higher population densities, and in areas with
more bike paths and lanes."

Conclusion

4. Conclusions
"Over the past decades, American local governments have changed local zoning ordinances to encourage bicycle parking
and cyclist showers in new large office buildings with the goal to increase bicycle commuting. The results of this analysis of
commuters in the Washington region indicate that bike parking and cyclist showers at work are associated with more bike
commuting—even after controlling for other determinants of cycling to work. The combined supply of bike parking, clothes
lockers, and cyclist showers has a statistically stronger influence on bike commuting than the provision of bike parking only.
Compared to no trip-end facilities for cyclists, both, bike parking and showers combined and bike parking alone are related to
more bike commuting. Results also indicate that free car parking at work is associated with less bike commuting; and that
workplace commuter transit benefits are not related to bike commuting."

Evaluating the Transport, Health, and Economic Impacts of New Urban Cycling Infrastructure in Sydney, Australia
///////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////


Economics

"Investment in ‘cycling specific’ infrastructure has consistently had positive results, generally
because the value of health benefits can be substantial and dwarfs the initial construction
costs. For example, the NSW Roads and Traffic Authority reported a ratio of 1.3:1 when
calculating the cost-benefit ratio of building missing links in its cycle network, using
conservative assumptions [22], and a specifically focused analysis of the Inner Sydney
Regional Bicycle Network found the cost-benefit ratio was 3.88:1 [23]." (Page 5)
