    <h1>Pokemon Battle</h1>
      <h2>Game Description:</h2>

    <h2>Objects and Arrays Needed to Represent Game Data:</h2>
  <h3>-Pokemon</h3>
  <p>	-Each Pokemon object will have a name, a type, hitpoints, four moves, and an attribute for
    attack, defense, accuracy, evasion, and speed.</p>
    <ul><li>- name - string data type</li>
      <li>- type - string data type</li>
      <li>- hitpoints - integer data type</li>
      <li>- each move will be a function</li>
      <li>- attack, defense, accuracy, evasion, and speed attributes will all be arrays with 13 elements of integers</li>
      </ul>
      <h2>Functions Needed</h2>
      <h3>-Move Functions</h3>
      <p>-There are 10 different moves available to use.  Each Pokemon will use 4 of the moves.<br>
        -There are to be 3 different Pokemon for the user to choose from upon starting the game, some moves are common to more than one Pokemon.<br>
        -Each move will have several attributes.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>- Move Name - string data type - name of the Move</li>
        <li>- Move Type - string data type - type of the Move (fire, water, ground, electric etc) - this affects the efficacy of the attack on the target Pokemon</li>
        <li>- Move Category - string data type - category of the Move (Physical, Status, or Special) - this affects which attributes of the target Pokemon the Move changes</li>
        <li>- Move PP - Power Points - integer data type - this is a counter of how many times a Move can be used in a single battle.  Each time the Move is used -1 to the counter</li>
        <li>- Move Power - integer data type - how much damage output the Move does to the damage multiplier</li>
        <li>- Move Accuracy - double data type - the chance the Move will hit the target Pokemon</li>
        <li>- Move Effect - string data type - which attribute the Move will affect</li>
        <li>- Move Target - string data type - which Pokemon the Move will apply to</li>
      </ul>
      <h3>Calculation and GUI functions</h3>
      <ul>
      <li>- Calculate Damage Function
      :This will use the attributes of the Move that is used on the given turn to calculate the damage output</li>

      <li>- Calculate Change Attribute Function:
      This will use the attributes of the Move that is used on the given turn to calculate the attributes of the target Pokemon that will be changed as a result</li>

      <li>- Update Pokemon Stats Function
      This will change all the affected attributes, hitpoints, and power points of each Pokemon after every turn and display the results to the user.</li>

      <li>- Messages Function
      This will display the various messages that are part of each turn.<br>
      * may need to be broken up into several functions<br>
      Parameters: the result of the Calculate Damage Function or the Calculate Change Attribute Function, depending on the move used that particular turn</li>
      </ul>
