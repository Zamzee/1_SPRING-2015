==========================================
 

// Description of Model
============================

Name: Pokemon Battle
=========================
Game Description:
==================
- A turn-based creature fighting game. Designed to behave as closely as possible to the original "Pokemon" games for the Nintendo Gameboy

// Objects and Arrays needed for representing game data
=========================================================
-Pokemon
==========
-Each Pokemon object will have a name, type, hitpoints, four moves, and attack, defense, accuracy, evasion, and speed attributes
- name - string data type
- type - string data type
- hitpoints - integer data type
- each move will be a function
- attack, defense, accuracy, evasion, and speed attributes
* will all be arrays with 13 elements of integers

// Functions needed
====================
- Move functions
-There are 10 different moves available to use. Each Pokemon will use 4 of the moves.

-There are to be 3 different Pokemon for the user to choose from upon starting the game, some moves are common to more than one Pokemon

*Each move will have several attributes
=========================================
- Move Name - string data type - name of the Move
- Move Type - string data type - type of the Move (fire, water, ground, electric etc) 
	- this affects the efficacy of the attack on the target Pokemon

- Move Category 
	- string data type - category of the Move (Physical, Status, or Special) - this affects which 	attributes of the target Pokemon the Move changes

- Move PP
===========
 - Power Points - integer data type - this is a counter of how many times a Move can be used in a single battle. 

* Each time the Move is used -1 to the counter
	- Move Power - integer data type - how much damage output the Move does to the damage multiplier
	- Move Accuracy - double data type - the chance the Move will hit the target Pokemon
	- Move Effect - string data type - which attribute the Move will affect
	- Move Target - string data type - which Pokemon the Move will apply to
		
- Calculate Damage Function
==============================
	-This will use the attributes of the Move that is used on the given turn to calculate the damage output
		
- Calculate Change Attribute Function 
=====================================
	-This will use the attributes of the Move that is used on the given turn to calculate the attributes of 	the target Pokemon that will be changed as a result
	
- Update Pokemon Stats Function
================================
	-This will change all the affected attributes, hitpoints, and power points of each Pokemon after every turn and display the results to the user.
		
- Messages Function
====================
	-This will display the various messages that are part of each turn.
	* may need to be broken up into several functions
	Parameters: the result of the Calculate Damage Function or the Calculate Change Attribute Function, 	depending on the move used that particular turn
